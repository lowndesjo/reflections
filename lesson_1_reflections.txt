Cmd + Shift + H always take you back to home.

To see hidden files: ls -a (they start with a dot)

To duplicate an existing repository: git clone

To turn a directory into a git repository: git init

When within a git project directory running ‘git log’ lists all the commits with their commit IDs and messages

You can see the difference between two versions by running ‘git diff _ID1_ _ID2_’

It helps to see the differences in colour which can be set using ‘git config --global color.ui auto’

You can always go back to a previous version that you know doesn’t have bugs if you accidentally introduce something bad. Run ‘git checkout _insert ID_’
