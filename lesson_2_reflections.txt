3 steps:
1. Working directory i.e. when you create a file and work in it
2. Staging area i.e. the waiting area for files before they get committed - add a file to this using ‘git add _filename_’
3. Repository i.e. the place where your git commits go - add files to this using ‘git commit’. Add a message according to the following style guide: http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/ 

Check the whereabouts of files using ‘git status’
