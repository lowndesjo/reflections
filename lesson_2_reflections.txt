—> 3 steps:
1. Working directory i.e. when you create a file and work in it
2. Staging area i.e. the waiting area for files before they get committed - add a file to this using ‘git add _filename_’
3. Repository i.e. the place where your git commits go - add files to this using ‘git commit’. Add a message according to the following style guide: http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/ 

Check the whereabouts of files using ‘git status’

To compare working directory and staging area use ‘git diff’ (without arguments)

To compare staging area to repository use ‘git diff —staged’

—> BRANCHES
Branches are useful if you want to keep a master copy, but also create a new version, which may be in a different language, may be experimenting with new features or may be an alternate, perhaps easier version of a game.

Check what branches exist: ‘git branch’

Create branch: ‘git branch _branchname_’

Change the branch you are working in ‘git checkout _branch you want_’
