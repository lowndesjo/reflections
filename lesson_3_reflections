GITHUB

*Adding a remote
    Add a new remote: ‘git remote add origin _URL_’
    Check which remotes exist: ‘git remote’
    Commit branches to remote: ‘git push -u _pushing to e.g. origin_ _branch committing eg master_’
    
  Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    - If someone else is contributing
    - If you want to be able to access it from multiple computers

  Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  	- Because you might not be ready to share a feature publicly yet; a feature often involves multiple commits
