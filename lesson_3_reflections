GITHUB

*Adding a remote
    Add a new remote: ‘git remote add origin _URL_’
    Check which remotes exist: ‘git remote’
    Commit branches to remote: ‘git push -u _pushing to e.g. origin_ _branch committing eg master_’
    
  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    - If someone else is contributing
    - If you want to be able to access it from multiple computers
